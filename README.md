<h3 align=left>Usage</h3>

<p>During gameplay, players control the paddle using the arrow keys. The objective is to bounce the ball off the paddle to break all the blocks on the screen without letting the ball fall off the bottom of the play area.</p>

<p>Each block broken earns points, and power-ups may appear upon block destruction. These power-ups enhance the paddle's abilitie, making it shoot the blocks temporarily.</p>

<p>The game ends when all blocks are destroyed, or the player loses all their lives. The player's score and the record will be displayed.</p>
